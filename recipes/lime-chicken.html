    <h3>Delicious Honey Lime Chicken</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. (0.4 kg) chicken thighs, deboned, skin-on</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1.5 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
      <li>3 dashes cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 big pinch salt</li>
      <li>chopped parsley</li>
      <li>lime wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (207°C).</li>
      <li>
        To debone the chicken thighs but keep the skin on, please refer to this
        video and post for the step-by-step. The skin makes this recipe
        extremely delicious.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub the minced garlic on the chicken thighs with your hands. Add honey,
        soy sauce, lime juice, cayenne pepper and salt to the chicken. (Double
        the marinade if you want it to be more "saucy"). Stir to combine well.
        Transfer the chicken and the honey mixture to a baking sheet lined with
        aluminum foil. Cover the chicken with aluminum foil to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the chicken for 20 minutes, or until cooked. If the sauce pools at
        the bottom of the foil, spoon and brush the sauce over the chicken.
        Broil the chicken for 1 minute or until the chicken skin is charred.
        Remove from heat, garnish with parsley. Squeeze the lime wedges over the
        chicken before serving.
