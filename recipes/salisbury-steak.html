    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>Steaks</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place breadcrumbs in a bowl. Use a box grater and grate the onion over
        the breadcrumbs. Mix with fingers, leave to soak for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining Salisbury Steak ingredients into the large bowl. Use your
        hands to mix until just combined. Mix well for a couple of minutes until
        the mixture becomes a bit "pasty" which will ensure your patties hold
        together well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide into 5 and pat firmly into oval patties around 3/4" / 1 2/3 cm
        thick.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Cooking and Gravy</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the steaks and cook the first
        side for 1 minute or until browned, then flip and brown the other side
        (they will still be raw inside). Remove onto plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        If skillet is looking dry, add a touch more oil. Add chopped onion and
        garlic and cook for 2 minute until onions are a bit translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the mushrooms into the skillet and cook for 2 - 3 minutes until
        golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat down to medium. Add butter. Once melted, add flour and cook
        for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add in beef broth, stirring as you go. Once mostly lump free,
        whisk in remaining Gravy ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add steaks along with the juices on the plate. Cook for 5 - 7 minutes,
        or until gravy is thickened, stirring occasionally around the steaks. If
        the gravy thickens too quickly, add more water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove steaks onto a plate. Taste gravy and adjust salt and pepper to
        taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve salisbury steaks topped with the mushroom gravy - over mashed
        potato is ideal! Sprinkle with a bit of parsley if desired.
